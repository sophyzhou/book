# Proposal

## Team Members

Peizhe Cao, Caleb Hsu, Lili Ji, Kavya Ravikumar

## Ideation

These ideation questions are the same as before. Your answers should represent
the integration of creative ideas from every team member.

* What is the name of your app?

Prolanner

* What collaborative activity can people do together using your app?

People can effectively collaborate on projects by creating and assigning tasks, communicating in real time via a chatroom, scheduling project meetings, and receiving notification reminders for different cards.

* What is the ideal number of concurrent users (must be at least 10 but no more than 40)?

Depending on the size of the event, anywhere from 10 to 25 users is ideal.

* What skills do people need in order to do this activity?

They need to know how to use a computer and plan project tasks.

* Is this activity for fun or for something practical?

Project planning tends to be practical, but it can be fun as well thanks to our app!

* How can a person see what everyone else is doing?

All team members can see tasks added in real time, but tasks that show up on an individual's page can be filtered based on assignment and due date.

* How can a person see the most recent result of everyone's collaborative effort?

The newest tasks appear at the top of the tasks queue by default, and can be sorted by due date, assignment, and priority.

* What can an admin see (i.e., God's mode)?

An admin is the project creator and can see all users affiliated with a particular project, add and remove users, and view / filter tasks for every user.

## Contributions

For each person on the team, jot down a list of ideas credited to that person.
It's okay to credit multiple people for the same idea. The rationale of this
section of the proposal is to demonstrate that everyone on the team contributes
useful ideas.

* Peizhe
  * project management
  * due date notifications
  * task filtering
  * direct messaging
* Caleb
  * scheduling events
  * task filtering
  * group messaging
* Lili
  * chatroom two-column format
  * task commenting
* Kavya
  * project management
  * tasks and project lists
  * admin permissions

## Plan

A reasonable way to implement a functional prototype of your together app
is to build upon the service-matching app (i.e. uber). Discuss what additional
efforts may be required from your team to develop the together app.

* What existing components of the uber app your team can reuse?
    * User login
    * Filters

* What new components and features your team may need to build?
    * Realtime notification for tasks, messages, assignments, etc.
    * Event / meeting scheduling
    * Automatically moving cards based on status

* What new skills your team will still need to acquire?
    * Learn how to do realtime notification based on users

## What's Next?

This is a preliminary proposal. Next week, your team will receive feedback and
will work on building a _mockup_ of this app. The week after that, your team
will start implementing the app.
